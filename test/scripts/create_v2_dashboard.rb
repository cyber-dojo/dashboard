  # What about in web's review page? 
  # Diff 0 - 1

  # http://localhost/review/show/SR3Fxc?was_index=1&now_index=2
  # Correctly showing wibble.txt was created, but not selected (cyber-dojo.sh is)
  # See web repo, source/app/views/review/lib/_pick_file.html.erb
  # which shows a bias to not selecting .txt files.
  #
  # Diff 2 - 3
  # http://localhost/review/show/SR3Fxc?was_index=2&now_index=3
  # Correctly showing wibble.txt is edited
  #
  # Diff 3 - 4
  # http://localhost/review/show/SR3Fxc?was_index=3&now_index=4
  # Correctly showing no diff, index=4 on review page, red traffic-light has underbar.
  #
  # Diff 0 - 4
  # http://localhost/review/show/SR3Fxc?was_index=0&now_index=4
  # Incorrectly showing same as 3-4
  # Is this because web's review page is actually changing this to 3-4?
  #
  # Diff 0 - 3
  # http://localhost/review/show/SR3Fxc?was_index=0&now_index=3
  # Incorrectly showing same as 2-3
  # Again suggesting web's review has changed this to 2-3
