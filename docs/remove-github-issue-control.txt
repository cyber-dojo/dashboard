The dashboard repo had a github-issue Trail-level control, as follows:

  github-issue:
    needs: [kosli-trail]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Kosli CLI
        uses: kosli-dev/setup-cli-action@v2
        with:
          version: ${{ vars.KOSLI_CLI_VERSION }}

      - name: Check git-commit message references a Github Issue
        run: |
          export COMMIT_MESSAGE=$(git log --format=%B -n 1 ${{ github.sha }})
          # Issue number can be specified as #1 or gh-1
          export GITHUB_ISSUE_NUMBER=$(echo $COMMIT_MESSAGE | grep -oE '(#|gh-)[0-9]+' | head -n 1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+')

          HTTP_CODE=$(curl --output /dev/null --location \
              -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
              -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
              --write-out "%{http_code}" \
              --silent \
              https://api.github.com/repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/issues/${GITHUB_ISSUE_NUMBER})
          if [[ ${HTTP_CODE} -eq 200 ]]; then
            export KOSLI_COMPLIANT=true
            export EXTERNAL_URL="--external-url=issue=https://github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/issues/${GITHUB_ISSUE_NUMBER}"
          else
            export KOSLI_COMPLIANT=false
            export EXTERNAL_URL=
          fi
          kosli attest generic \
            --compliant="${KOSLI_COMPLIANT}" \
            ${EXTERNAL_URL} \
            --name=github-issue


This has been removed because there is also a pull-request control.
This means that if I have a git-commit message "blah blah #132"
and I do a pull-request, the pull request will create a new git-commit
message that might look like "More text (#145)\n\n blah blah #132".
This would match the issue number as 145 and not 132.
See the external_urls in the drop-down JSON for ticket evidence in
https://app.kosli.com/cyber-dojo/flows/dashboard-ci/trails/d62faf375cbc5e4e3c6c2692f74007f8262b8c4e
Also, the pull-request may well span more than one git-commit and
there could be more than one github-issue referenced across these.
