- if detailed[x] and you click a RAG, it would be nice if
  the review opened in detailed[x] mode.

- supposed to only show an avatar if it has at least one RAG.
  check this...
  for detailed[x] I think we want at least one file-event?
  Confirmed. Start a new avatar, in detailed[ ] OFF, you dont see it.
  In detailed[x] you do.
  Is this ok?
