- if detailed[x] and you click a RAG, it would be nice if
  the review opened in detailed[x] mode.
  http://localhost/review/show/nGnDsn?now_index=3
  would become, eg
  http://localhost/review/show/nGnDsn?now_index=3&diff=detailed

- if there are a large number of file-events and you click detailed[x]
  make sure the display auto-scrolls horizontally so the most recent 
  events are in view.

- supposed to only show an avatar if it has at least one RAG.
  check this...
  for detailed[x] I think we want at least one file-event?
  Confirmed. Start a new avatar, in detailed[ ] OFF, you dont see it.
  In detailed[x] you do.
  Is this ok?
