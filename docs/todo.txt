The demo opens REf1t8 but this is not a version 2 kata
so it does not work when you click on a traffic-light and
get the review page. Specifically, the < > navigation buttons
do not work. If you click the [first<] button it does not
work and you get a javascript error:

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'content')
    at outputRefresher (5U2J18:1465:60)
    at 5U2J18:1458:9
    at HTMLDivElement.<anonymous> (5U2J18:670:11)\

  const outputRefresher = (event) => {
    const stdout = makeNoDiffOutput('stdout', event.stdout.content);
    ...
  }

  Looks like event does not have stdout, or event.stdout does not have content.
