The demo opens REf1t8 but this is not a version 2 kata so it does not work 
when you click on a traffic-light and get the review page. Specifically, 
on the review page < > navigation if you click the [first<] button you 
get a javascript error:

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'content')
    at outputRefresher (5U2J18:1465:60)
    at 5U2J18:1458:9
    at HTMLDivElement.<anonymous> (5U2J18:670:11)

  const outputRefresher = (event) => {
    const stdout = makeNoDiffOutput('stdout', event.stdout.content);
    ...
  }

  Looks like event does not have stdout, or event.stdout does not have content.
  Fixing this for v0,v1 is not so important.
  But I do need a v2 demo.
