differ
------
Trails.yml  reports Trails to Org=cdt Flow=differ
change it to
Trails.yml  reports Trails to Org=cd Flow=differ-service
- and don't make report to CDF
- so no new Flow=differ reports

Then repeat this basic process for all 10 repos.
At that point cyber-dojo-trails can be archived as it has served its purpose.

We can probably also Archive Flow=differ so you only see
a differ Flow if you are looking at an older snapshot.
